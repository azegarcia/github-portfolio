# Get to know about me

Hello, I am Azeneth S. Garcia, and I am currently an Application Developer.
I started working on 2020 during pandemic and I am a pandemic graduate. My first
relevant job was being a Software Design Engineer in Ionics EMS Inc but I am a
freelance developer since 2017. My first programming language was C#. I enjoyed 
Java during my college days but I ended up focusing on Python and Javascript as 
soon as I graduated college.

## My working experiences

* Application Developer (Elgada BPO Solutions Inc.) 2021-PRESENT
* Software Design Engineer (Ionics EMS Inc.) 2020-2021
* Junior Network Engineer (TENA Innovation and Technology Solutions) -- INTERNSHIP
* Freelancing since 2017

## My work as an Application Developer

* My task is mostly about creating python bots and bug fixing.
* I once was exposed to optimizing our site using ReactJS.
In creating bots and bug fixing, I am exposed to the following technologies:
  * Programming languages: Python, Javascript, Ruby and SQL
  * Python libraries: BeautifulSoup, requests, Selenium, Numpy, Pandas, pdf2text, pyPDF2,
                      openpxyl, and a whole lot more.
  * Python Toolkits: SQLAlchemy
In my ReactJS experience I learned:
  * Code-splitting using dynamic imports
  * Profiling(debugging) to know where the bottlenecks are
  * To use useCallBack and useMemo hooks for caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated
  * Windowing to render to the DOM only the visible portion to the user
  * Lazy loading to improve the page load time when we show several images
  * To run scripts in parallel to perform long and intensive processes in a separate thread without slowing the rendering of the UI

## My work as a Software Design Engineer

* My task is mostly about creating monitoring systems and data loggers, programming embedded
  systems and configuring microcontrollers and sensors (Industry 4.0).
* I am working on a linux environment.
In creating those, I am exposed to the following technologies:
  * Programming languages: C++, PHP, SQL, Javascript and Python
  * Tech Stack used: LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) Stack and MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) Stack
  * Hardwares used: Raspberry Pi, Microcontrollers made by our company, BLE sensors and Zigbee sensors 
  * Databases used: MySQL, MongoDB and Apache Cassandra
  * Local cloud server

## My work as a Junior Network Engineer

* My task is mostly about creating hardware and software innovations.
In creating those, I am exposed to the following technologies:
  * Programming languages: PHP, SQL, Javascript and Python
  * Applications used: Sketchup, AutoCAD, ExpressPCB, Cisco Packet Tracer
  * Hardwares used: Raspberry Pi, Arduino and different types of sensors
  * Databases used: MySQL
  * Local cloud server
During my stay, I also experienced:
  * structured cabling
  * cctv installation
  * PCB etching

## My work as a Freelance Developer

As a freelance developer, I am exposed to the following technologies:
  * Programming languages: PHP, SQL, Javascript, Python, Kotlin and APEX
  * Applications used: Sketchup, AutoCAD, Android Studio, Salesforce, Netdocs, MIT App Inventor,
                        Arduino IDE, XAMPP, ExpressPCB, WinPROLadder(PLC Programming), MATLAB
  * Hardwares used: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, NodeMCU and different types of sensors
  * Databases used: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
